## About

**Welcome to semantyk.com!** 🥳

This is the official repository for the [Semantyk](https://www.semantyk.com)
client.

Semantyk is not just another app – it's designed to be a game-changer
multi-platform application in the world of knowledge management, experience and
exploration.

Think of it as your go-to platform for everything related to
creating, managing, and sharing knowledge graphs and decentralized linked data,
but with a twist. **It's social, it's collaborative, and it's super intuitive**
thanks to its innovative knowledge exploration models.

At Semantyk, we understand that the growing and exponential adoption for AI
is making knowledge management more important than ever. That's why we're all
about reshaping our relationship to knowledge. We're blending top-notch
tech like AI, spatial computing, data visualization
models, and a design that's all about the user. It's not just smart; it's
user-smart.

Privacy, security and data ownership are big deals for us. That's why we're
big on [Solid](https://solidproject.org) technology – it keeps your data yours,
while still playing nice with other data management methods.

Ever wanted to explore data in a way that's almost sci-fi? Semantyk makes that
happen. Dive into multi-dimensional experiences, interact with data in ways
you've never imagined, and get insights on complex info with ease. Plus, our AI
isn't just smart; it's adaptive, learning from how you use it to make your
experience smoother and more personalized.

Under the hood, Semantyk is built to scale. We're talking micro-services
architecture and containerization, which means easy deployment and management,
especially in the cloud. This setup ensures Semantyk is always up and running,
adaptable, and ready for the future of tech.

In a nutshell, Semantyk stands at the cutting edge of collaborative and
decentralized knowledge management. It's built for anyone and everyone who wants
to explore, manage, and share knowledge in a whole new way.
